In one operation, you can choose integer i and subtract 2^i + num2 from num1.\nReturn the minimum number of operations to make num1 equal to 0. If it is impossible to make num1 equal to 0, return -1.\nExamplesExample 1:\nInput: num1 = 3, num2 = -2Output: 3Explanation: We can apply the following operations:- Operation 1: i = 2, subtract 2^2 + (-2) = 4 - 2 = 2. Now num1 = 3 - 2 = 1.- Operation 2: i = 2, subtract 2^2 + (-2) = 4 - 2 = 2. Now num1 = 1 - 2 = -1.- Operation 3: i = 0, subtract 2^0 + (-2) = 1 - 2 = -1. Now num1 = -1 - (-1) = 0.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: num1 = 5, num2 = 7Output: -1Explanation: It is impossible to make num1 equal to 0.\n\nMy Unique ApproachInstead of the traditional mathematical modeling approach, I developed an iterative simulation method that directly mimics the operation process:\nKey InsightThe core idea is to simulate the process step by step:\n\nFor each potential number of operations k, subtract num2 from num1 \nCheck if the remaining value can be represented as a sum of exactly k powers of 2\nUse binary representation to count the minimum number of powers of 2 needed\n\nAlgorithm Logic\nEarly termination: If num2 &gt;= num1, return -1 (impossible case)\nIterative checking: For each k starting from 1:\nCalculate current = num1 - k * num2\nCount the number of 1‚Äôs in binary representation of current\nIf k &gt;= count_of_ones, we can potentially use k operations\n\n\nValidation: Ensure the solution is mathematically valid\n\nMy SolutionPython Implementationclass Solution(object):    def makeTheIntegerZero(self, num1, num2):        &quot;&quot;&quot;        :type num1: int        :type num2: int        :rtype: int        &quot;&quot;&quot;        # Early termination: if num2 &gt;= num1, impossible to reach 0        if num2 &gt;= num1:            return -1        else:            k = 1            ini = num1  # Store original num1 for validation                        while True:                # Simulate subtracting num2 for k operations                num1 -= num2                                # Convert to binary and count 1&#x27;s                bin1 = bin(num1)[2:]                count1 = bin1.count(&#x27;1&#x27;)                                # Check if we can use k operations                if k &gt;= count1:                    # Validation checks                    if ini &gt; k * num2:                        if ini - k * num2 &lt; k:                            return -1                        return k                    else:                        return -1                else:                    # Need more operations                    k += 1                    bin1 = 0                    count1 = 0\n\nAlgorithm BreakdownLet me explain each part of my unique approach:\nStep 1: Early Terminationif num2 &gt;= num1:    return -1\nIf num2 is greater than or equal to num1, it‚Äôs impossible to make num1 zero because each operation adds at least num2 to the subtraction.\nStep 2: Iterative Simulationk = 1ini = num1  # Store original valuewhile True:    num1 -= num2  # Simulate the num2 part of each operation\nInstead of calculating target = num1 - k * num2 directly, I simulate the process by subtracting num2 in each iteration.\nStep 3: Binary Analysisbin1 = bin(num1)[2:]count1 = bin1.count(&#x27;1&#x27;)\nFor the current value, count how many 1‚Äôs are in its binary representation. This tells us the minimum number of powers of 2 needed.\nStep 4: Feasibility Checkif k &gt;= count1:    # We have enough operations to represent the number    if ini &gt; k * num2:        if ini - k * num2 &lt; k:            return -1        return k\nThe key insight: if we have k operations and only need count1 powers of 2, we can use the extra operations by ‚Äúsplitting‚Äù larger powers of 2.\nComplexity Analysis\nTime Complexity: O(log(num1)), as we iterate at most log(num1) times\nSpace Complexity: O(1), using only constant extra space\n\nWhy This Approach WorksThe Mathematical FoundationMy iterative approach is essentially equivalent to the mathematical formula:\nnum1 - k√ónum2 = 2^i‚ÇÅ + 2^i‚ÇÇ + ... + 2^i‚Çñ\n\nBut instead of calculating num1 - k√ónum2 directly, I simulate it step by step:\n\nStart with k = 1\nSubtract num2 from num1 (simulating one operation)\nCheck if the result can be represented with k powers of 2\nIf not, increment k and repeat\n\nValidation Logic ExplainedThe nested conditions in my code serve important purposes:\nif ini &gt; k * num2:  # Ensure we haven&#x27;t subtracted too much    if ini - k * num2 &lt; k:  # Ensure target &gt;= k (necessary condition)        return -1    return k\n\nThis ensures that:\n\nThe total subtraction k * num2 doesn‚Äôt exceed the original num1\nThe remaining value ini - k * num2 is at least k (since each power of 2 is at least 1)\n\nTest Cases WalkthroughLet‚Äôs trace through some examples using my approach:\nExample 1: num1 &#x3D; 11, num2 &#x3D; 1Initial: num1 = 11, num2 = 1, ini = 11k = 1:- num1 = 11 - 1 = 10- bin(10) = &quot;1010&quot;, count = 2- k (1) &lt; count (2), so increment kk = 2:- num1 = 10 - 1 = 9  - bin(9) = &quot;1001&quot;, count = 2- k (2) &gt;= count (2) ‚úì- ini (11) &gt; k*num2 (2) ‚úì- ini - k*num2 = 9 &gt;= k (2) ‚úì- Return 2\n\nExample 2: num1 &#x3D; 5, num2 &#x3D; 7Initial: num1 = 5, num2 = 7Early termination: num2 (7) &gt;= num1 (5)Return -1\n\n\nConclusionThis iterative simulation approach provides a unique perspective on solving LeetCode 2749. While the mathematical modeling approach is more direct, my method offers better intuition about what‚Äôs actually happening in each operation.\nThe key insight is that we can separate the problem into:\n\nThe num2 component (handled by iteration)\nThe powers of 2 component (handled by binary analysis)\n\nThis separation makes the solution both understandable and efficient.\n\nTutorial texts partly co-generated by Claude-4-Sonnet.\nHope this analysis helps you understand my unique approach to LeetCode 2749!

If no such subarrays exist, return 1.\nExamplesExample 1:\nInput: nums = [2,5,7,8,9,2,3,4,3,1]Output: 3Explanation: The subarrays [2,5,7] and [8,9,2] are not valid.But [5,7,8] and [9,2,3] are not adjacent.The valid answer is [2,5,7] (length 3) adjacent to... wait, let me recalculate.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]Output: 2Explanation: The entire array is strictly increasing with length 5.We can split it into [1,2] and [3,4], giving us k=2.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,2,3,4,3,4,5]Output: 2Explanation: [1,2,3] and [2,3,4] are adjacent strictly increasing subarrays.We can pick k=2 from both.\n\n\nMy Unique ApproachInstead of using complex data structures or multiple passes, I developed an elegant single-pass solution that tracks consecutive increasing segments and intelligently compares them at boundaries.\nKey InsightThe core idea is to recognize that at any point where an increasing sequence breaks, we have two opportunities to maximize k:\n\nSplit Strategy: Divide the current increasing subarray in half\nAdjacent Strategy: Pair the previous increasing subarray with the current one\n\nBy tracking both the current and previous subarray lengths, we can evaluate both strategies in O(1) time at each boundary.\n\nAlgorithm LogicThe Tracking MechanismI maintain three critical variables:\n\ncount: Length of the current strictly increasing subarray\nlastcount: Length of the previous strictly increasing subarray\nmaxm: The maximum k found so far\n\nThe Decision PointsAt each position where nums[i] &gt;= nums[i+1] (a break in the increasing sequence), we:\n\nCompare lastcount and count (adjacent strategy)\nConsider count // 2 (split current subarray)\nUpdate our maximum accordingly\n\nEdge Case Handling\nTwo-element arrays: Always return 1\nFully increasing arrays: Return len(nums) // 2\nFinal subarray: Must be checked after the loop ends\n\n\nMy SolutionPython Implementationclass Solution(object):    def maxIncreasingSubarrays(self, nums):        &quot;&quot;&quot;        :type nums: List[int]        :rtype: int        &quot;&quot;&quot;        # Edge case: minimum possible input        if len(nums) == 2:            return 1                count = 1          # Current increasing subarray length        lastcount = 0      # Previous increasing subarray length        maxm = 0           # Maximum k found                # Single pass through the array        for i in range(len(nums) - 1):            if nums[i] &lt; nums[i + 1]:                # Continue the increasing sequence                count += 1            else:                # Break point: evaluate both strategies                # 1.

Split strategy: count // 2                maxm = max(maxm, min(count, lastcount), count // 2)                                # Shift: current becomes previous                lastcount = count                count = 1                # Don&#x27;t forget the final subarray!        if lastcount &gt; 0:            maxm = max(maxm, min(lastcount, count), count // 2)                # Special case: entire array is strictly increasing        if count == len(nums):            return count // 2                # If no valid pair found, minimum is always 1        return maxm if maxm != 0 else 1\n\n\nAlgorithm BreakdownLet me walk you through each critical part of my solution:\nStep 1: Edge Case - Two Elementsif len(nums) == 2:    return 1\n\nFor the smallest possible input, we can only have two subarrays of length 1, so return 1 immediately.\nStep 2: The Core Loop - Tracking Increasesfor i in range(len(nums) - 1):    if nums[i] &lt; nums[i + 1]:        count += 1\n\nAs we iterate, we simply count consecutive strictly increasing elements. This gives us the length of the current increasing subarray.\nStep 3: Boundary Analysis - The Magic Happens Hereelse:    maxm = max(maxm, min(count, lastcount), count // 2)    lastcount = count    count = 1\n\nWhen we hit a boundary (increasing sequence breaks), we:\n\nCompare three values:\n\nCurrent maximum: maxm\nAdjacent strategy: min(count, lastcount) - take the smaller of the two adjacent subarrays\nSplit strategy: count // 2 - split the current subarray in half\n\n\nUpdate tracking: Move current to previous, reset current to 1\n\n\nStep 4: Final Subarray Checkif lastcount &gt; 0:    maxm = max(maxm, min(lastcount, count), count // 2)\n\nAfter the loop, we still have the final increasing subarray to consider. We must check it against the previous one using the same logic.\nStep 5: Fully Increasing Arrayif count == len(nums):    return count // 2\n\nIf the entire array is strictly increasing (no breaks occurred), the optimal solution is to split it in half.\n\nComplexity AnalysisTime Complexity: O(n)We iterate through the array exactly once, performing constant-time operations at each step:\n\nComparison: O(1)\nCounter updates: O(1)\nMax calculations: O(1)\n\nTotal: Single pass ‚Üí O(n)\nSpace Complexity: O(1)We only use three integer variables regardless of input size:\n\ncount\nlastcount\nmaxm\n\nNo additional data structures needed!\n\nWhy This Approach WorksThe Mathematical FoundationThe problem essentially asks: What‚Äôs the maximum k such that we can find two adjacent strictly increasing subarrays of length k?\nMy approach recognizes that:\n\nAny strictly increasing subarray of length L can be split into two adjacent subarrays of length L&#x2F;2\n\nExample: [1,2,3,4] ‚Üí [1,2] and [3,4]\n\n\nTwo adjacent strictly increasing subarrays of lengths A and B can form two subarrays of length min(A,B)\n\nExample: [1,2,3] (length 3) and [5,6] (length 2) ‚Üí k &#x3D; 2\n\n\nAt any boundary, we choose the better strategy\n\nSplit current: count // 2\nUse adjacent: min(count, lastcount)\n\n\n\nThe Greedy ChoiceThis solution is greedy in nature - at each decision point, we choose the maximum possible value. This works because:\n\nOnce we pass a boundary, the previous subarray length is fixed\nWe can‚Äôt ‚Äúgo back‚Äù and change it\nTherefore, making the locally optimal choice (max of the three options) is globally optimal\n\n\nTest Cases WalkthroughLet‚Äôs trace through some examples to see the algorithm in action:\nExample 1: nums &#x3D; [2,5,7,8,9,2,3,4,3,1]Initial: count=1, lastcount=0, maxm=0i=0: 2&lt;5 ‚Üí count=2i=1: 5&lt;7 ‚Üí count=3i=2: 7&lt;8 ‚Üí count=4i=3: 8&lt;9 ‚Üí count=5i=4: 9‚â•2 ‚Üí Break!     maxm = max(0, min(5,0), 5//2) = max(0, 0, 2) = 2     lastcount=5, count=1i=5: 2&lt;3 ‚Üí count=2i=6: 3&lt;4 ‚Üí count=3i=7: 4‚â•3 ‚Üí Break!     maxm = max(2, min(3,5), 3//2) = max(2, 3, 1) = 3     lastcount=3, count=1i=8: 3‚â•1 ‚Üí Break!     maxm = max(3, min(1,3), 1//2) = max(3, 1, 0) = 3     lastcount=1, count=1Final check:     maxm = max(3, min(1,1), 1//2) = max(3, 1, 0) = 3Output: 3 ‚úì\n\nExample 2: nums &#x3D; [1,2,3,4,5]Initial: count=1, lastcount=0, maxm=0i=0: 1&lt;2 ‚Üí count=2i=1: 2&lt;3 ‚Üí count=3i=2: 3&lt;4 ‚Üí count=4i=3: 4&lt;5 ‚Üí count=5No breaks occurred!count == len(nums) ‚Üí return 5//2 = 2Output: 2 ‚úì\n\nExample 3: nums &#x3D; [5,4,3,2,1]Initial: count=1, lastcount=0, maxm=0i=0: 5‚â•4 ‚Üí Break!     maxm = max(0, min(1,0), 1//2) = max(0, 0, 0) = 0     lastcount=1, count=1i=1: 4‚â•3 ‚Üí Break!     maxm = max(0, min(1,1), 1//2) = max(0, 1, 0) = 1     lastcount=1, count=1... (continues with all breaks)Final: maxm = 1Output: 1 ‚úì\n\n\nComparison with Alternative ApproachesApproach 1: Two-Pass SolutionIdea: First pass records all increasing subarray lengths, second pass finds maximum k.\n# First pass: record lengthslengths = []count = 1for i in range(len(nums)-1):    if nums[i] &lt; nums[i+1]:        count += 1    else:        lengths.append(count)        count = 1lengths.append(count)# Second pass: find max kmaxm = 0for i in range(len(lengths)-1):    maxm = max(maxm, min(lengths[i], lengths[i+1]))for length in lengths:    maxm = max(maxm, length // 2)\n\nDrawback: \n\nTime: Still O(n) but two passes\nSpace: O(n) for the lengths array\nLess elegant code\n\nApproach 2: Dynamic ProgrammingIdea: Track increasing lengths in a DP array.\nDrawback:\n\nOvercomplicated for this problem\nO(n) space required\nNo performance benefit\n\nWhy My Approach is Better\n\n\nMetric\nMy Solution\nTwo-Pass\nDP\n\n\n\nTime\nO(n) - 1 pass\nO(n) - 2 passes\nO(n)\n\n\nSpace\nO(1)\nO(n)\nO(n)\n\n\nCode Length\n~20 lines\n~30 lines\n~35 lines\n\n\nReadability\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\n‚≠ê‚≠ê\n\n\n\nKey TakeawaysAlgorithm Design Insights\nGreedy works when future doesn‚Äôt affect past: Since we‚Äôre moving forward and can‚Äôt change previous subarrays, greedy choices are safe.\n\nTrack minimal state: We only need to remember the previous subarray length, not all previous subarrays.\n\nBoundary analysis is powerful: The break points give us natural decision points.\n\n\nCoding Best Practices\nHandle edge cases first: The len(nums)==2 check simplifies the main logic.\n\nDon‚Äôt forget the final element: After loops, always check if there‚Äôs remaining data to process.\n\nUse meaningful variable names: count, lastcount, maxm clearly indicate their purpose.\n\n\n\nConclusionThis single-pass tracking solution demonstrates that many problems have elegant solutions when you:\n\nIdentify the key decision points (boundaries between increasing subarrays)\nTrack minimal necessary state (current and previous lengths)\nApply greedy logic at each decision point (maximize k locally)\n\nThe beauty of this approach lies in its simplicity - we achieve optimal time and space complexity with clear, maintainable code.\n\nTutorial texts partly co-generated by Claude-4-Sonnet.\nHope this detailed walkthrough helps you understand my efficient approach to this problem!
