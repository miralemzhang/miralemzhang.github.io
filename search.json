In one operation, you can choose integer i and subtract 2^i + num2 from num1.\nReturn the minimum number of operations to make num1 equal to 0. If it is impossible to make num1 equal to 0, return -1.\nExamplesExample 1:\nInput: num1 = 3, num2 = -2Output: 3Explanation: We can apply the following operations:- Operation 1: i = 2, subtract 2^2 + (-2) = 4 - 2 = 2. Now num1 = 3 - 2 = 1.- Operation 2: i = 2, subtract 2^2 + (-2) = 4 - 2 = 2. Now num1 = 1 - 2 = -1.- Operation 3: i = 0, subtract 2^0 + (-2) = 1 - 2 = -1. Now num1 = -1 - (-1) = 0.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: num1 = 5, num2 = 7Output: -1Explanation: It is impossible to make num1 equal to 0.\n\nMy Unique ApproachInstead of the traditional mathematical modeling approach, I developed an iterative simulation method that directly mimics the operation process:\nKey InsightThe core idea is to simulate the process step by step:\n\nFor each potential number of operations k, subtract num2 from num1 \nCheck if the remaining value can be represented as a sum of exactly k powers of 2\nUse binary representation to count the minimum number of powers of 2 needed\n\nAlgorithm Logic\nEarly termination: If num2 &gt;= num1, return -1 (impossible case)\nIterative checking: For each k starting from 1:\nCalculate current = num1 - k * num2\nCount the number of 1’s in binary representation of current\nIf k &gt;= count_of_ones, we can potentially use k operations\n\n\nValidation: Ensure the solution is mathematically valid\n\nMy SolutionPython Implementationclass Solution(object):    def makeTheIntegerZero(self, num1, num2):        &quot;&quot;&quot;        :type num1: int        :type num2: int        :rtype: int        &quot;&quot;&quot;        # Early termination: if num2 &gt;= num1, impossible to reach 0        if num2 &gt;= num1:            return -1        else:            k = 1            ini = num1  # Store original num1 for validation                        while True:                # Simulate subtracting num2 for k operations                num1 -= num2                                # Convert to binary and count 1&#x27;s                bin1 = bin(num1)[2:]                count1 = bin1.count(&#x27;1&#x27;)                                # Check if we can use k operations                if k &gt;= count1:                    # Validation checks                    if ini &gt; k * num2:                        if ini - k * num2 &lt; k:                            return -1                        return k                    else:                        return -1                else:                    # Need more operations                    k += 1                    bin1 = 0                    count1 = 0\n\nAlgorithm BreakdownLet me explain each part of my unique approach:\nStep 1: Early Terminationif num2 &gt;= num1:    return -1\nIf num2 is greater than or equal to num1, it’s impossible to make num1 zero because each operation adds at least num2 to the subtraction.\nStep 2: Iterative Simulationk = 1ini = num1  # Store original valuewhile True:    num1 -= num2  # Simulate the num2 part of each operation\nInstead of calculating target = num1 - k * num2 directly, I simulate the process by subtracting num2 in each iteration.\nStep 3: Binary Analysisbin1 = bin(num1)[2:]count1 = bin1.count(&#x27;1&#x27;)\nFor the current value, count how many 1’s are in its binary representation. This tells us the minimum number of powers of 2 needed.\nStep 4: Feasibility Checkif k &gt;= count1:    # We have enough operations to represent the number    if ini &gt; k * num2:        if ini - k * num2 &lt; k:            return -1        return k\nThe key insight: if we have k operations and only need count1 powers of 2, we can use the extra operations by “splitting” larger powers of 2.\nComplexity Analysis\nTime Complexity: O(log(num1)), as we iterate at most log(num1) times\nSpace Complexity: O(1), using only constant extra space\n\nWhy This Approach WorksThe Mathematical FoundationMy iterative approach is essentially equivalent to the mathematical formula:\nnum1 - k×num2 = 2^i₁ + 2^i₂ + ... + 2^iₖ\n\nBut instead of calculating num1 - k×num2 directly, I simulate it step by step:\n\nStart with k = 1\nSubtract num2 from num1 (simulating one operation)\nCheck if the result can be represented with k powers of 2\nIf not, increment k and repeat\n\nValidation Logic ExplainedThe nested conditions in my code serve important purposes:\nif ini &gt; k * num2:  # Ensure we haven&#x27;t subtracted too much    if ini - k * num2 &lt; k:  # Ensure target &gt;= k (necessary condition)        return -1    return k\n\nThis ensures that:\n\nThe total subtraction k * num2 doesn’t exceed the original num1\nThe remaining value ini - k * num2 is at least k (since each power of 2 is at least 1)\n\nTest Cases WalkthroughLet’s trace through some examples using my approach:\nExample 1: num1 &#x3D; 11, num2 &#x3D; 1Initial: num1 = 11, num2 = 1, ini = 11k = 1:- num1 = 11 - 1 = 10- bin(10) = &quot;1010&quot;, count = 2- k (1) &lt; count (2), so increment kk = 2:- num1 = 10 - 1 = 9  - bin(9) = &quot;1001&quot;, count = 2- k (2) &gt;= count (2) ✓- ini (11) &gt; k*num2 (2) ✓- ini - k*num2 = 9 &gt;= k (2) ✓- Return 2\n\nExample 2: num1 &#x3D; 5, num2 &#x3D; 7Initial: num1 = 5, num2 = 7Early termination: num2 (7) &gt;= num1 (5)Return -1\n\n\nConclusionThis iterative simulation approach provides a unique perspective on solving LeetCode 2749. While the mathematical modeling approach is more direct, my method offers better intuition about what’s actually happening in each operation.\nThe key insight is that we can separate the problem into:\n\nThe num2 component (handled by iteration)\nThe powers of 2 component (handled by binary analysis)\n\nThis separation makes the solution both understandable and efficient.\n\nTutorial texts partly co-generated by Claude-4-Sonnet.\nHope this analysis helps you understand my unique approach to LeetCode 2749!
